# Information Geometry #
Information Geometry is trying to reformulate part of statistics and Machine learning in to a geometry framework. 
It may serve as a bridge between Stat&ML with geometry, and hopefully, this will provide a way to borrow methods and ideas from 
deep and very well studied mathematics to front edge research of ML topics.
