# QFT #
The application of QFT to condensed matter physics has been proved to be exciting, Quantum order can be understanded by long term entanglement. 
And in recent years, physics researchers, for example Prof. Xiaogang Wen, are proposing to explain matter and enery as a form of information.
All these research and hypothesis require a new form of Mathematics and ideas. The research of this topic may lead us to a stage of combining 
front edge of Math, physics, statistics, information theory and Machine learning.
