# Introduction to quantum field theory for mathematicians
* lectured by Jeffrey M. Rabin

## Lec1: Classical Methanics
* Hamiltonian approach -> canonical formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space
* Lagrangian approach -> path integral formalation
### Lagrangian approach
$$S = \int$$
