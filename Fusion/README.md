# Let one topic talk with the other one topic #
There are some well known conversition between different research areas. I would like to get more intuition from the existing ones and try to touch some new ones.
## Existing dialogs ##
* QFT/String theory and Differential/Algebraic Geometry
* Information theory and differential Geometry
* Quantum entanglement/quantum computing and Tensor algebra
* Elliptic differential equantions and Topology (Hodge theory)

## More dialogs ##
* DeepLearning and (Local)geometry
 - what is relation between architecture and algorithms in Machine learning?
 - Is there a utility function that can put together architecture and algorithms?
 - How to translate Machine learning problems to mathematics problems on this level?
 - What equation we are trying to solve in ML problems? Is there such a type of equations?
* Is there any topological property in Machine learning.
 - What is global geometyr in Machine Learning?
 - What is Hodge theory in Machine Learning?
* Machine learning and quantum computation
 - What is the next generation of Mathematics that will best serve to quantum machin learning/AI?
